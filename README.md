# README

This project creates a Photoshaing application similar to Instagram using the tutorial found here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE

The main functionality of the application is to allow a user to register an account, login/logout once they have their account, add new posts to their wall, and display a wall of posts that have accumulated on the app. One additional simple functionality I implemented on top of those described through the tutorial is I allowed for the wall to be viewed by anyone (whether or not logged in) but only users that are logged in can add pictures to the wall. Below you can find screenshots of the application performing the above functionality. 

To run the application you must have Ruby on Rails installed on your machine. If that is the case, you can cd into the directory containing the project using your terminal or command line, run the command "rails s" to activate the local rails server, then go to "http://localhost:3000" in a web browser.
